        * In .env, Set CLIENT_SSO_REDIRECT_URL to <FRONT_END_ENDPOINT>/ for redirects after logging in from google. example http://localhost:3000/
    * Update the following in the freeapi project:
        * Add an environment variable in .env file for forgot password redirection, and point it to the <FRONT_END_ENDPOINT>/forgot-password, as follows: 
          ```FORGOT_PASSWORD_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/forgot-password```
        * In src/controllers/apps/auth/user.controller.js file, Update the forgot password controller to use the above environment variable when sending an email
          by using ```${process.env.FORGOT_PASSWORD_REDIRECT_URL}/${unHashedToken}``` when calling the sendEmail function inside the controller.
