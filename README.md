6. **Advanced APIs for Portfolio Building**: In addition to beginner-level endpoints, our API hub also provides advanced APIs to challenge and stretch your skills. These APIs enable you to tackle more complex integration scenarios, helping you build a robust portfolio of projects to showcase your expertise.

By combining open source principles, accessibility, and a focus on learning, our API hub project paves the way for developers to thrive in the world of API integration. Join our vibrant community and embark on an exciting journey of discovery, growth, and innovation.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Avoiding Data Loss and Self-Hosting

# Background:

Our open-source project is currently hosted on a remote server, where we are forced to reset the entire server, **including the file system and MongoDB database**, every **2 hours** to avoid incurring additional costs.

This process results in the **deletion of all image/static files and a reset of the entire database on the server.**

## What does this mean for you?

**Data Loss:**
Any changes made during the 2-hour interval (on the remote server), including uploaded images and user data, will be lost and unrecoverable.

**Service Interruption:**
The server reset might disrupt your development and testing processes for a certain duration while the server is rebooting (for 1-2 minutes).

## Recommended Solutions:

**Local API Usage:**
For development and testing purposes, we strongly recommend using the API locally on your machine by **cloning the project**.

This ensures that your work is not affected by the server resets and allows you to maintain a stable development environment on your local machine.

**Self-Hosting on Railway _(recommended for personal projects)_:**
To self-host the FreeAPI.app application, you can take advantage of a pre-built template that is readily available.

# How to contribute - Guidelines

We welcome your interest in contributing to our open source project!

To contribute to FreeAPI, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them using conventional commit messages: `git commit -am "feat: Add new feature"`. For more details on the commit format and other guidelines, please refer to the [Contributor Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
4. Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin feat/your-feature-name`.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository, explaining the changes you've made and providing any necessary details.

Here's a guide on how you can effectively contribute to our API hub:

1. Pull Requests for Readme Updates: Please refrain from sending pull requests solely for updating the project's readme file. While we appreciate the importance of clear and concise documentation, we prefer to focus on substantial code contributions and feature enhancements.

2. Grammar Updates: Our team values effective communication, but we're not grammar sticklers. You don't need to send pull requests solely for grammar fixes or minor language improvements. Instead, concentrate on the core functionalities and features of the project.

3. Avoid Updating Existing Public APIs: To maintain stability and consistency, we discourage direct updates to existing public APIs within the API hub. These APIs have been thoroughly tested and approved. However, if you encounter any bugs or issues, we encourage you to open an issue on our project's issue tracker to notify us.

4. Build New Project APIs: We encourage you to explore your creativity and contribute by building complete project APIs. These APIs should provide comprehensive solutions that can assist developers in constructing complex projects to showcase their skills and abilities. Your contributions in this area will greatly benefit the community.

5. Draft a Proposal and Discuss on Discord: Before diving into your project, we recommend drafting a proposal. This can include a mind map or outline of the API you intend to build and its potential benefits. Join our Discord community, where you can share your proposal, discuss ideas, and gather feedback from fellow contributors. Engaging in these discussions will enhance your backend portfolio and help shape the future direction of the project.

We appreciate your enthusiasm and look forward to your valuable contributions to our open source API hub project.

Together, we can foster a collaborative environment and make a significant impact in the API integration landscape.
